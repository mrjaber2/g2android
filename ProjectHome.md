## What is G2Android ? ##

G2Android is an open source (GPL v2) Gallery2 client for the Android platform.

Browsing a G2 gallery using the Android built in Webkit browser is not really easy ...

Noting this lack, G2Android was created and aims to be an easy to use and reliable Gallery2 client, using the capabilities of the android platform.

G2Android runs on Android, and has been tested on the SDK emulator and on the HTC Dream (or G1 or T-Mobile GPhone), from version 1.5 to 2.2.
