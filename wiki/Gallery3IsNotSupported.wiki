#Gallery3IsNotSupported

= Reasons =

  * Gallery3 is still in beta stage
  * The choice of the remote API is not made yet (custom REST or FlickR style, see http://codex.gallery2.org/Gallery3:API)
  * I asked on the Gallery Developer mailing list if something was functional  yet and Tim answered : "_Anthony, great that you are trying to create a remote client, but unfortunately Gallery3 doesn't have a remote API yet.We have an open ticket, http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/gallery/ticket/665, but that's not slated until release 3.1. Tim_"

So until anything changes, Gallery3 IS NOT SUPPORTED in G2Android
